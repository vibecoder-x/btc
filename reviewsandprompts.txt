All the original pages are still working well
⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES STILL REMAINING:
🔴 Transaction Detail Pages - STILL BROKEN
All individual transaction pages return null/empty content. This is your #1 priority to fix.

Examples that don't work:

/tx/812a7f7c0f38849e2a82965090b659f5cc50b42a6a36a033a3cb76c35a296974
All other transaction links from block pages
📋 MISSING PAGES & FEATURES:
1. Transaction Detail Page (CRITICAL - Priority #1)
Status: ❌ Not working - all TX pages return null

2. Address Explorer Page (High Priority)
Status: ❌ Not found

Example: /address/[bitcoin-address]

3. User Dashboard (Medium Priority)
Status: ❌ Not found

Post-login dashboard showing API usage
Example: /dashboard
4. Mempool Live Page (Medium Priority)
Status: ⚠️ Partial - /mempool exists but returns null
